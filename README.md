👋 Hello, World! I'm @K03Rat, a passionate computer science student on a journey to explore the depths of technology and innovation. 💻

🎓 Currently pursuing computer science degree at the University of Galway, with a keen interest in software development and data analysis.

🔍 I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow, whether it's through personal projects, internships, or collaborating with fellow enthusiasts.

💡 Fascinated by the intersection of theory and practical application, I enjoy diving into projects that challenge me to think critically and creatively.
